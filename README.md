## Cards notation

- card suits are H (Hearts), D (Diamonds), C (Clubs), S (Spades)
- card ranks are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K, A (hmm self explainatory I think :P )
- <Suit>\_<Rank>
- for example H_2 means "2 serce", H_K means "kr√≥l serce"
- png/jpeg files of cards on client should have these names
